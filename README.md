# About The CARRA COVID-19 Global Pediatric Rheumatology Database

The CARRA-sponsored [COVID-19 Global Pediatric Rheumatology Database](https://carragroup.org/research-registry/projects/covid-19-global-pediatric-rheumatology-database) is now live! This is a new, online COVID-19 database for all pediatric patients with rheumatic and related autoimmune diseases.

Note: This CARRA effort includes data elements of particular interest to COVID-19 in pediatric rheumatology and is different than the general data collection effort of the [‘U.S. Pediatric COVID-19 Registry’](http://www.pids.org/news/764-usa-pediatric-covid-19-registry.html) study sponsored by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Transplant Group (PIDTRAN), which focuses on study of all immuno-compromised as well as healthy patients. We are collaborating with this study and will SHARE OUR DATA WITH EFFORTS TARGETED AT BROADER POPULATIONS such as this, so request that you report your cases to the CARRA COVID-19 surveillance projects as indicated below.

In order to better understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness on patients with pediatric rheumatic diseases and related autoimmune conditions, CARRA is sponsoring a number of COVID-19 surveillance efforts and is collaborating with the newly formed [COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance](https://rheum-covid.org).

As part of this effort, CARRA is now collecting data related to COVID-19 using these
mechanisms:

* Patients enrolled in the CARRA Registry. Subjects who are currently enrolled in the CARRA Registry and who test positive for SARS-CoV-2, can now have this reported as an Event of Special Interest (ESI) in the CARRA Registry. As with any ESI report, sites will be paid for entering these reports.
* Patients not already enrolled in the CARRA Registry. CARRA has sponsored a new global, pediatric-specific data collection study, the [COVID-19 Global Pediatric Rheumatology Database Survey](https://login.redcapcloud.com/survey.jsp?code=iIWU2MjOQOwRMUJh) for reporting of all patients with any type of pediatric rheumatic disease, including inflammatory brain diseases and primary autoimmune eye diseases, under 19 years old (patients 19 or older with these conditions can be reported to our adult rheumatology collaborators at UCSF [here](https://rheum-covid.org/provider-registry-gate/)). This study has been approved by the Boston Children’s Hospital IRB for collection of a limited data set with waiver of informed consent and authorization. More information about this study is available on the CARRA website here and you can register to provide data for the study right now.
* Patient self-reporting. CARRA is co-sponsoring the [Patient Experience Survey](https://rheum-covid.org/patient-survey/) (Jon Hausmann, PI, Boston Children's Hospital), which seeks to understand how the novel coronavirus pandemic is impacting the lives of individuals and their families with rheumatic diseases. The survey also provides a mechanism for those who have developed COVID-19 illness to self-report detailed information on their symptoms, treatments, and outcomes. CARRA is also actively exploring additional mechanisms for patients and families impacted by the pandemic to become involved in research - please follow our project on the [CARRA website](https://carragroup.org/research-registry/projects/covid-19-global-pediatric-rheumatology-database) to learn more and how to contribute and participate!
 
We understand how challenging the times are now and appreciate whatever time and effort you are able to spare to contribute to these surveillance efforts. We very much hope that these approaches will enable all of us to rapidly improve our understanding of the impact of COVID-19 and approaches to treating our patients, as well as many others.
